## Deployment Flow

Always follow this order:
1. Make changes
2. Build and verify (`npm run build`)
3. **Commit to git** (`git add` + `git commit`)
4. **Push to remote** (`git push`) — Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub on push

Always push immediately after committing so changes deploy to Vercel. Do not leave commits unpushed.
